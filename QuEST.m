     * Note additional functions and their usage messages are fetched when CreateRemoteQuESTEnv is called.
     * The additional functions are provided through WSTP and use the QuEST` prefix to share namespace with this package.
     * This includes QuEST`Private` functions which are thus only called from within this package, which does not need to
     * explicitly use that package. 
     * Note also that public WSTP functions e.g. CloneQureg called from this package must be prefixed here with QuEST` so
     * that they are not incorrectly automatically given a QuEST`Private` prefix. This often will not trigger an error 
     * but will cause incorrect behaviour. When in doubt, give the full explicit name e.g. QuEST`CloneQureg or
     * QuEST`Private`ApplyCircuitInternal.
